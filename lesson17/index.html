                    Sometimes movies are more complicated than four-volume novels. But you learn to read books in
                    school,
                    but you don't learn to watch movies. And without preparation, it can be difficult to enjoy watching
                    a
                    movie.

                    In this 8-session course we will learn how to be conscious viewers. We will get acquainted with the
                    stages of film production and learn how to watch a movie through the eyes of a screenwriter,
                    director
                    and editor. We will understand genres and look at the most important films, from Citizen Kane to The
                    Matrix.
